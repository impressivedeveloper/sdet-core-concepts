            <h1>Day-01: Software Testing Fundamentals</h1>
            <h2>What is Software Testing?</h2>
            <p>Software testing is a process of investigation to find bugs/defects/issues and report to minimize defects to develop a quality software.</p>
            <h2>Why software testing is so important?</h2>
            <p>Because without it quality of software product development is not possible!</p>

            <h2>How a software is developed?</h2>
            <p>A software is developed in a series of process. The process is called SDLC.</p>

            <h2>What is SDLC?</h2>
            <p>SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It does have 8 phases:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Planning & requirements gathering</li>
                <li>Designing</li>
                <li>Implementation</li>
                <li>Testing</li>
                <li>Deployment</li>
                <li>Maintenance</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>Manual Testing| Day-02</h1>
            <h2>Why software quality fails?</h2>

            <h2>Types of IT companies?</h2>
            <p>There are two types of IT Companies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Project-based/ Service-based: TCS, Infosys, Accenture etc </li>
                <li>Product-based: Google, Microsoft, IBM etc</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is SDLC?</h2>
            <p>SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality software applications.</p>

            <h2>Software Development Models</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Waterfall Model</li>
                <li>Agile-scrum Model</li>
                <li>V Model</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Waterfall Model</h2>
            <img src="assets/waterfall-model.png" alt="waterfall-model" width="1200" height="700">
            <ul>
                <li>Waterfall model is sequential model and invented in 1970!</li>
                <li>Has to be completed development stage to start testing phase</li>
                <li>100% has to be completed to go to next stage</li>
                <li>Cannot entertain new requirements once a phase started</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Advantages & disadvantages in Waterfall Model: It does have both advantages & disadvantages</h2>
            <h3>Advantages: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Quality of the product will be good</li>
                <li>Less number of bugs</li>
                <li>Initial investment is low</li>
                <li>Preferred for small projects</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Disadvantages: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Client cannot change the requirements</li>
                <li>Any defect in the requirements will carry forward to all the stages</li>
                <li>Testing will start only after the development</li>
                <li>Final software will be ready after the final stage of the waterfall model</li>
                <li>Cannot apply for large projects</li>
            </ul>
